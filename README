#Outreachy: ceph - radosgw-admin application
#Boost::program_options demo

What this program does: 
- shows how boost handles double dash options (long and short)
- shows different methods for storing arguments 
  (by reference or automatic storage in po::variables_map for later processing)
- shows you can catch unrecognized options manually
  (program_options CAN'T recognize anything without dashes)
- shows you can throw boost errors
- shows you can generate usage() for dashed options automatically
- implicitly handles --uid 200 and --uid=200 syntax (although boost prints the former in --help)

What this program doesn't do: 
- deal with commands in a OO way, necessary for a bigger application (struct, class or an std type)
- validate the options passed by the user to make sure they match the command
- break out functionality into smaller sub-functions, ie. parse_cmd, get_cmd, etc.
